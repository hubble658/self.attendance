# Self Attendance

**Self Attendance** is a comprehensive, privacy-focused academic tracking tool designed for effortless attendance management. Built with modern Android technologies, it revolutionizes how students manage their class attendance by moving beyond simple counters to a **calendar-first approach**.

Unlike traditional apps that only show percentages, Self Attendance provides an intuitive visual calendar interface where you can mark attendance for specific dates, view patterns at a glance, and get smart **AI-powered insights** about your bunk allowance.

## 🚀 New in v2.0.0: Timetable Notification System

The latest update introduces a highly requested, fully automated notification engine.

*   **Exact-Time Alerts**: Notifications trigger precisely at the start of your class using Android's `AlarmManager` API, bypassing standard battery optimization delays.
*   **Interactive Actions**: Mark your attendance directly from the notification shade. Options for **"Attended"** and **"Missed"** allow for instant database updates without unlocking the phone or opening the app.
*   **Reliable Persistence**: The system automatically reschedules all alarms upon device reboot or app updates, ensuring no class is ever forgotten.
*   **Conflict Handling**: Intelligently manages overlapping schedules and delivers distinct alerts for simultaneous events.

## Why Self Attendance Stands Out

Most attendance trackers are just simple counters with no context. Self Attendance solves this:

| Traditional Apps ❌ | Self Attendance ✅ |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No Date Association**: Can't see *when* you attended. | **Date-Specific Records**: Every attendance is tied to a calendar date. |
| **Just Numbers**: No visual history. | **Visual Calendar**: See streaks, gaps, and monthly patterns instantly. |
| **Manual Math**: You figure out bunking logic. | **AI Insights**: Smart calculations tell you *exactly* how many classes you can bunk. |
| **Limited History**: Can't view past months. | **Monthly Navigation**: Browse complete attendance history. |
