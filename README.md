## Overview

**Self Attendance** is a **first-of-its-kind** calendar-based attendance tracking application that revolutionizes how students manage their class attendance. Unlike traditional attendance apps that only show percentages and counts, Self Attendance provides an **intuitive visual calendar interface** where you can mark attendance for specific dates, view attendance patterns at a glance, and get **smart AI-powered insights** about your bunk allowance.

### Why Self Attendance is Unique

**No other app in the market** combines these features:
- ✅ **Calendar-First Approach** - Mark attendance by date, not just incrementing counters
- ✅ **Visual Attendance Patterns** - See your attendance streaks and gaps on a calendar
- ✅ **Smart Attendance Insights** - AI tells you exactly how many classes you can bunk or need to attend
- ✅ **Date-Specific Tracking** - Every attendance record is tied to a specific date
- ✅ **Historical Data** - Complete attendance history with date-wise records

Most attendance apps only offer basic counters. **Self Attendance is the first to combine calendar visualization with intelligent attendance analysis.**

## Why Self Attendance Stands Out

### The Problem with Existing Apps
Most attendance trackers are just **simple counters**:
- ❌ No date association - Can't see when you attended
- ❌ No visual patterns - Just numbers
- ❌ Manual calculations - You have to figure out bunk allowance yourself
- ❌ No historical context - Can't view past months

### Self Attendance's Innovation
Self Attendance solves these by being **calendar-first**:
- ✅ **Date-specific records** - Every attendance tied to a calendar date
- ✅ **Visual calendar view** - See patterns and streaks instantly
- ✅ **AI-powered insights** - Smart calculations for bunk allowance
- ✅ **Monthly navigation** - Browse attendance history by month
- ✅ **Streak tracking** - Monitor continuous present/absent days

**No other app combines calendar visualization with intelligent attendance analysis like Self Attendance.**
